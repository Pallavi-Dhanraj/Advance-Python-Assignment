    "Ans1-A class is called an Abstract class if it contains one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method that is        declared, but contains no implementation. Abstract classes may not be instantiated, and its abstract methods must be            implemented by its subclasses."

This       method when called, allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class. The super() function allows us to avoid         using the base class name explicitly."
